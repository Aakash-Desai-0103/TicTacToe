# TicTacToe
This is my first mini-project: a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs entirely in the command line. It's a two-player game where you can challenge a friend.  This project was a fantastic exercise in practicing fundamental Python concepts and building a complete, functioning program from scratch.
